			Swimming is something that all children enjoy but for children of color this activity can turn deadly. According to the Center for Disease Control, average drowning rates of Native and Black children of Native and Black descent are about two times higher than other races. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This is in part because many children of color do not know how to swim. According to the American Red Cross, 64% of African-American, 45% of Hispanic/Latino, and 40% of Caucasian children have little to no swimming competency. Many of these children have parents that also don't know how to swim which creates fear of the water.
		</p>
		<p>
			Black People Will Swim is hoping to change that. The Jamaica, Queens based organization was founded by Paulana Lamonier who created the organization to destroy the stereotype that “Black people don’t swim”. Lessons are held at York College for people of all ages from infants to the elderly in the hopes that eventually everyone will swim.

			In an interview with Forth Worth Star Telegram Carol Irwin, a public health professor at the University of Memphis,said, "It's a life skill. It's like teaching your child to look both ways before they cross the street,"
